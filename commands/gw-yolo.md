One-shot command: Claude Code plans, creates issue, implements solution, and creates PR through consultation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW ORDER ‚ö†Ô∏è
**NEVER SKIP OR REORDER THESE STEPS:**
1. Create GitHub issue FIRST
2. Extract issue number from URL
3. Create worktree with issue-based branch name
4. ONLY THEN start implementation with TodoWrite

**IF YOU START WITH TODOWRITE, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG!**

## Purpose

Give Claude Code a task description, and it will:

**Default (Consultation Mode)**:
1. **ANALYZE & PLAN** - Present comprehensive implementation plan
2. **GET APPROVAL** - User reviews and can modify the plan
3. **CREATE GITHUB ISSUE** (MUST BE FIRST - NO TODOWRITE YET!)
4. **EXTRACT ISSUE NUMBER** (from the created issue URL)
5. **CREATE WORKTREE** (using issue number in branch name)
6. **START TODOWRITE** (ONLY AFTER steps 1-3 are complete)
7. Actually implement the solution
8. Run tests and checks
9. Create PR when ready

**With -f/--force (Immediate Mode)**:
Skip steps 1-2 and proceed directly to issue creation and implementation.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE TODOWRITE UNTIL AFTER ISSUE AND WORKTREE ARE CREATED!

All in one command - thoughtful YOLO with quality by default.

## Usage

```bash
# Default: consultation mode with ultrathink analysis (plan before executing)
/user:gw-yolo "Add user authentication with JWT"

# Force immediate execution (skip consultation)
/user:gw-yolo "Add user authentication" -f
/user:gw-yolo "Add user authentication" --force

# Specify thinking level (default: ultrathink)
/user:gw-yolo "fix typo" -l think                          # Basic analysis (~5 min)
/user:gw-yolo "add feature" -l "think hard"                # Moderate analysis (~10 min)  
/user:gw-yolo "refactor API" -l "think harder"             # Deep analysis (~15 min)
/user:gw-yolo "redesign architecture" -l ultrathink        # Deepest analysis (20+ min)

# Exclude original request from issue
/user:gw-yolo "Add sensitive feature" -np
/user:gw-yolo -np "Add sensitive feature" -l "think hard"

# Create draft PR
/user:gw-yolo "experimental feature" --draft

# Combine flags
/user:gw-yolo "fix typo" -f -l think                       # Force + quick analysis
/user:gw-yolo "complex feature" -l ultrathink -np          # Deep analysis + no prompt

# Note: git worktree is ALWAYS used (no -w flag needed)
```

## Workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: WORKFLOW ORDER IS MANDATORY ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Default Flow (Consultation Mode)**:
```
USER: /user:gw-yolo "Fix TypeScript errors"
         ‚Üì
[1] ANALYZE & PRESENT PLAN
         ‚Üì
[2] USER APPROVES/MODIFIES
         ‚Üì
[3] CREATE GITHUB ISSUE (#123)
         ‚Üì
[4] EXTRACT ISSUE NUMBER (123)
         ‚Üì
[5] CREATE WORKTREE (./worktrees/fix-123-typescript)
         ‚Üì
[6] CD INTO WORKTREE
         ‚Üì
[7] NOW START TODOWRITE with:
    - Analyze current errors
    - Fix TypeScript errors
    - Fix ESLint errors
    - Run tests
    - Create PR (LAST!)
```

**Force Flow (-f flag)**:
```
USER: /user:gw-yolo "Fix TypeScript errors" -f
         ‚Üì
[Skip to step 3 above]
```

**DO NOT START WITH TODOWRITE!**

# Create issue - THIS IS ALWAYS FIRST
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue create --title "$TASK_DESC" --body "$ISSUE_BODY")
ISSUE_NUM=$(echo $ISSUE_URL | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
echo "‚úÖ Created issue #$ISSUE_NUM"
echo "üîó $ISSUE_URL"
```

### 1.5. Import GitHub issue checkboxes to TodoWrite

```bash
echo "üìã Importing issue tasks to TodoWrite for synchronization..."

# CRITICAL: Import ALL checkboxes from the created GitHub issue to TodoWrite
# This ensures perfect synchronization throughout the workflow
#
# Claude MUST implement the following logic:
#
# 1. Fetch issue body:
#    ISSUE_BODY=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json body -q .body)
#
# 2. Parse ALL checkboxes (both [ ] and [x]):
#    - Extract all checkbox lines with their states
#    - Preserve exact task text for proper matching
#
# 3. Import to TodoWrite with proper states:
#    - First task "Create GitHub issue..." ‚Üí status: 'completed' (already done)
#    - Second task "Set up git worktree..." ‚Üí status: 'pending' (will be done next)
#    - All other tasks ‚Üí status: 'pending'
#    - Use IDs like: issue-$ISSUE_NUM-task-1, issue-$ISSUE_NUM-task-2, etc.
#
# 4. This ensures TodoWrite matches GitHub issue from the start
#
# Example: If issue has these checkboxes:
# - [ ] Create GitHub issue and get issue number
# - [ ] Set up git worktree and branch
# - [ ] Analyze existing code structure
# - [ ] Implement core functionality
#
# TodoWrite should have ALL of them, with the first marked as completed

echo "‚úÖ TodoWrite synchronized with GitHub issue #$ISSUE_NUM"
```

### 2. Create branch and setup (ALWAYS uses worktree)

```bash
# Options already parsed in step 1

# Create branch name
# IMPORTANT: Claude must generate an appropriate branch name based on the task description
echo "ü§î Analyzing task to generate branch name..."

# Claude will analyze the task and generate an appropriate branch name
# Based on: "$TASK_DESC"
#
# Branch naming rules for Claude:
# - Choose appropriate prefix: feat-, fix-, docs-, refactor-, test-, perf-, chore-
# - Keep it concise (2-4 words after prefix)
# - Use lowercase and hyphens (NO SLASHES)
# - Be specific but not too long
# - Include issue number when using feat/fix/chore prefixes
#
# Examples:
# - "root„ÅÆREADMEÊõ¥Êñ∞" ‚Üí "docs-update-readme"
# - "„É≠„Ç∞„Ç§„É≥„Ç®„É©„Éº‰øÆÊ≠£" ‚Üí "fix-$ISSUE_NUM-login-error"
# - "Ê§úÁ¥¢Ê©üËÉΩËøΩÂä†" ‚Üí "feat-$ISSUE_NUM-add-search"
# - "„ÉÜ„Çπ„ÉàËøΩÂä†" ‚Üí "test-add-user-api-tests"
# - "„É™„Éï„Ç°„ÇØ„Çø„É™„É≥„Ç∞" ‚Üí "refactor-clean-auth-logic"
#
# Claude should understand the intent and create a meaningful branch name

# For now, using a simple fallback (Claude will override this during execution)
BRANCH_NAME="feat-$ISSUE_NUM-update"

# ALWAYS use worktree for gw-yolo
REPO_NAME=$(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))
# Worktree path is same as branch name (no conversion needed!)
WORKTREE_PATH="./worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME"

echo "üå≤ Creating worktree for isolated development..."
git worktree add -b "$BRANCH_NAME" "$WORKTREE_PATH"
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
echo "üìÅ Working in: $WORKTREE_PATH"

# Install dependencies in the new worktree
echo "üì¶ Installing dependencies..."
pnpm install
echo "‚úÖ Dependencies installed"

# Sync .env files from main repository
echo "üîÑ Syncing .env files..."
/user:gw-env-sync
echo "‚úÖ Environment files synced"

echo "üí° This keeps your main workspace clean while Claude Code works!"
```

### 3. Claude Code implements solution

```bash
echo "üìã Updating TodoWrite task status..."

# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TodoWrite should already have ALL tasks imported from GitHub issue
# By this point:
# - GitHub issue is CREATED ‚úÖ
# - Worktree is CREATED ‚úÖ
# - TodoWrite has ALL tasks from the issue
#
# Claude MUST now:
# 1. Update the "Set up git worktree and branch" task to 'completed'
# 2. Begin working on the next pending task
# 3. Use incremental sync to keep GitHub issue updated
#
# IMPORTANT: After completing each major task:
# - Mark it as completed in TodoWrite
# - Run: /user:gw-iss-sync to update GitHub issue checkboxes
# This ensures continuous synchronization
# SYNC WORKFLOW:
# - TodoWrite already contains ALL tasks from GitHub issue
# - First task (Create issue) is already marked 'completed' ‚úÖ
# - Second task (Set up worktree) should now be marked 'completed' ‚úÖ
# - Work through remaining tasks, marking each as 'in_progress' then 'completed'
# - Run /user:gw-iss-sync after major milestones to update GitHub checkboxes

echo "üß† Analyzing codebase..."
echo "üíª Implementing solution..."

# AUTOMATIC SYNC WITH TODOWRITE:
# Claude MUST sync GitHub issue checkboxes IMMEDIATELY when updating TodoWrite
#
# CRITICAL: When marking a task as completed in TodoWrite, Claude MUST:
# 1. Use TodoWrite tool to mark task as completed
# 2. IN THE SAME MESSAGE, use Bash tool to update GitHub checkbox:
#    ```bash
#    TASK_TEXT="exact task text from TodoWrite"
#    ISSUE_BODY=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json body -q .body)
#    UPDATED_BODY=$(echo "$ISSUE_BODY" | sed "s/- \[ \] $TASK_TEXT/- [x] $TASK_TEXT/")
#    gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUM --body "$UPDATED_BODY"
#    ```
# 3. Both tools MUST be called in ONE message for atomic updates
#
# This ensures GitHub issue is ALWAYS in sync with TodoWrite

# THINKING LEVEL HANDLING:
# Based on $THINKING_LEVEL, Claude adjusts analysis depth:
#
# - think: Basic implementation, quick analysis (~5 min)
#   - Simple task breakdown
#   - Basic tests
#   - Single commit for small changes
#
# - think hard: Moderate analysis (~10 min)
#   - Detailed implementation plan
#   - Good test coverage
#   - Logical commit boundaries
#
# - think harder: Deep analysis (~15 min)
#   - Consider edge cases
#   - Comprehensive tests
#   - Performance considerations
#   - Multiple atomic commits
#
# - ultrathink: Deepest analysis (20+ min) - DEFAULT
#   - Architecture considerations
#   - Security implications
#   - Scalability analysis
#   - Extensive test coverage
#   - Detailed documentation
#   - Granular commits with clear purpose

# This is where Claude Code:
# 1. Uses Read/Grep/Glob to understand the codebase
# 2. Uses TodoWrite to track progress (with correct order)
# 3. Uses Edit/Write to implement the solution
# 4. Runs tests incrementally
# 5. Fixes any issues that arise

# Claude will actually implement based on the task description
# This is not simulated - real implementation happens here
```

### 4. Incremental commits

```bash
# Claude commits at logical points:
# - After each major component
# - After adding tests
# - After documentation updates

echo "üíæ Committing progress..."
# Claude should commit with issue reference:
# git add -A && git commit -m "feat: implement [component]

This implements issue #$ISSUE_NUM"
```

### 5. Final checks and PR creation

```bash
echo "üîç Running final checks..."

# Run checks individually and stop on first failure
echo "1/3: TypeScript check..."
if ! npx tsc --noEmit; then
  echo "‚ùå TypeScript check failed!"
  echo "üîß Fixing type errors..."
  # Claude should fix type errors here
  exit 1
fi

echo "2/3: ESLint check..."
if ! pnpm -w run lint:fresh; then
  echo "‚ùå Lint check failed!"
  echo "üîß Fixing lint errors..."
  # Claude should fix lint errors here
  exit 1
fi

echo "3/3: Running tests..."
if ! pnpm test; then
  echo "‚ùå Tests failed!"
  echo "üîß Fixing test failures..."
  # Claude should fix test failures here
  exit 1
fi

# All checks passed
if true; then
  echo "‚úÖ All checks passed"
  
  # MANDATORY: Sync TodoWrite progress to GitHub issue
  echo "üîÑ Syncing progress to GitHub issue..."

## Options

- `-f` or `--force`: Skip consultation and execute immediately (old behavior)
  - Useful when you're certain about the task
  - Saves time for simple, well-understood tasks
  - Maintains the original YOLO spirit

- `-l` or `--level`: Control thinking depth (default: ultrathink)
  - `think`: Basic analysis (~5 min) - simple tasks
  - `think hard`: Moderate analysis (~10 min) - standard features
  - `think harder`: Deep analysis (~15 min) - complex features
  - `ultrathink`: Deepest analysis (20+ min) - architectural changes

- `--draft`: Create PR as draft (useful for very large features)

- `-np` or `--no-prompt`: Exclude original request from issue body

**Note**: Git worktree is ALWAYS used - no flag needed. This ensures:

- Main workspace stays clean
- Parallel development is possible
- No interference with other work
- Easy cleanup after completion

## Important Notes

1. **Claude Code does the actual implementation** - not just scaffolding
2. **Smart commits** - Claude commits at logical points
3. **Test-driven** - Claude writes tests alongside implementation
4. **Self-correcting** - If tests fail, Claude fixes them
5. **Context-aware** - Claude studies your codebase patterns

## When to use gw-yolo

- **New features**: "Add user profile page"
- **Bug fixes**: "Fix memory leak in data processing"
- **Refactoring**: "Refactor API client to use async/await"
- **Integrations**: "Add Stripe payment integration"
- **Any task you'd normally implement yourself**

## Limitations

- Very large architectural changes may need human oversight
- Claude follows existing patterns in your codebase
- Complex business logic may need clarification via gw-iss-edit

This is thoughtful "vibe coding" - describe what you want, Claude Code plans it, you approve, then it builds!

## Important: Always Uses Worktree

`gw-yolo` ALWAYS creates a git worktree because:

1. **Isolation**: Claude Code works in a separate directory
2. **Parallel work**: You can continue other work in main directory
3. **Clean separation**: No mixing of different features
4. **Multiple Claude sessions**: Can run multiple gw-yolo commands simultaneously

**Note**: Worktree cleanup is handled by the user after PR merge
