Create a GitHub issue through consultation and planning.

## Usage

```bash
# Default: consultation mode with ultrathink level (deepest analysis)
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error"

# Specify thinking level (default: ultrathink)
/user:gw-iss-create "fix typo" -l think              # Basic analysis (~5 min)
/user:gw-iss-create "add feature" -l "think hard"    # Moderate analysis (~10 min)
/user:gw-iss-create "refactor API" -l "think harder" # Deep analysis (~15 min)
/user:gw-iss-create "redesign arch" -l ultrathink    # Deepest analysis (20+ min)

# Force immediate creation (skip consultation)
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error" -f
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error" --force

# Exclude original request from issue body
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error" -np
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error" --no-prompt

# Combine flags
/user:gw-iss-create "fix login error" -f -np
/user:gw-iss-create "complex feature" -l "think hard" -np
```

      # Validate thinking level
      case "$THINKING_LEVEL" in

### Example 2: Bug Report
```
/user:gw-iss-create "users can't login after midnight"

üìã Analyzing your request...

## Proposed Issue

**Title**: Fix login failure occurring after midnight
**Type**: Bug
**Labels**: bug, critical, authentication

### Overview
Users are experiencing login failures when attempting to authenticate after midnight. This appears to be a timezone or timestamp validation issue.

### Tasks
- [ ] Reproduce the issue in development environment
- [ ] Check timezone handling in authentication logic
- [ ] Review JWT token expiration logic
- [ ] Verify database timestamp comparisons
- [ ] Add logging to identify exact failure point
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases around midnight
- [ ] Test in different timezones

### Implementation Notes
- Priority: Critical - affecting user access
- Likely related to UTC/local time conversion
- Check for any scheduled jobs running at midnight

## Force Mode (-f flag)

When using `-f` or `--force`, the command behaves like the original version:
- Immediately creates the issue without consultation
- No interactive planning phase
- Useful when you're certain about the issue details

```bash
/user:gw-iss-create "fix typo in README" -f
# Creates issue immediately without consultation
```

## Benefits of Consultation Mode

1. **Better Issue Quality**
   - Well-structured task lists
   - Clear implementation approach
   - Comprehensive scope definition

2. **Avoid Incomplete Issues**
   - Catch missing requirements early
   - Add important details before creation
   - Reduce need for issue edits later

3. **Learning & Planning**
   - Understand complexity before starting
   - Identify potential challenges
   - Better time estimation

4. **Flexibility**
   - Iterative refinement
   - Add context as needed
   - Cancel if requirements unclear

## Thinking Levels

The `-l` or `--level` option controls the depth of Claude's analysis:

### 1. **think** (Basic ~5 min)
- Quick task breakdown
- Basic implementation steps
- Suitable for simple tasks like typos, small bug fixes
- Example: "fix README typo", "update version number"

### 2. **think hard** (Moderate ~10 min)
- Detailed task breakdown
- Implementation approach with technical details
- Consider common edge cases
- Suitable for standard features and bug fixes
- Example: "add user profile page", "fix login timeout"

### 3. **think harder** (Deep ~15 min)
- Comprehensive task analysis
- Multiple implementation approaches considered
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance implications
- Suitable for complex features or significant changes
- Example: "implement caching layer", "refactor authentication"

### 4. **ultrathink** (Deepest 20+ min) - DEFAULT
- Architecture-level considerations
- Security implications
- Scalability and future extensibility
- Integration with existing systems
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Suitable for major features or architectural changes
- Example: "migrate to microservices", "implement real-time sync"

### Examples with Different Levels

```bash
# Simple typo fix - basic analysis is enough
/user:gw-iss-create "fix spelling in docs" -l think

# Standard feature - moderate analysis
/user:gw-iss-create "add dark mode toggle" -l "think hard"

# Complex refactoring - deep analysis
/user:gw-iss-create "optimize database queries" -l "think harder"

# Major architectural change - deepest analysis (default)
/user:gw-iss-create "implement event-driven architecture"
```

## Important Notes

- **Default is consultation mode with ultrathink** - deepest analysis before creating
- **Default thinking level is ultrathink** - ensures comprehensive planning
- Use `-f` flag for immediate creation when confident
- Use `-l` flag to adjust analysis depth based on task complexity
- Can combine with `-np` to exclude original request
- GitHub issue is only created after confirmation
- No local changes are made by this command
